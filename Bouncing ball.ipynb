    "### Bouncing Balls\n",
    "\n",
    " - A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor, h, is known.\n",
    "\n",
    " - He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).\n",
    "\n",
    " - His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    " - How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?\n",
    "\n",
    " - Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    " > 1. Float parameter \"h\" in meters must be greater than 0\n",
    " > \n",
    " > 2. Float parameter \"bounce\" must be greater than 0 and less than 1\n",
    " > \n",
    " > 3. Float parameter \"window\" must be less than h.\n",
    "\n",
    " - If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Note: The ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball is strictly greater than the window parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- h = 3, bounce = 0.66, window = 1.5, result is 3\n",
    "\n",
    "- h = 3, bounce = 1, window = 1.5, result is -1 \n",
    "\n",
    "(Condition 2) not fulfilled).\n",
    "```"
